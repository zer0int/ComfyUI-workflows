# ComfyUI-workflows
Workflows to implement fine-tuned CLIP Text Encoders with ComfyUI / SD, SDXL, SD3, Flux
----
## Update 10/OCT/2024:
- Added `node-a-good-idea.json`

- Is basically bonkers and node-a-good-idea to use
- Requires [my Flux Layer Shuffle nodes](https://github.com/zer0int/ComfyUI-CLIP-Flux-Layer-Shuffle)
- Requires [my fork of Block Patcher](https://github.com/zer0int/Block_Patcher_ComfyUI), unless my "custom sigmas" pull is accepted
- Maximizes the ways in which the models involved in Flux can be manipulated in incomprehensible ways
- Use at your own discretion 
- I am sorry for the confusion! /o\
